# Lighting Setback Error: Delayed Onset

## Description

  def description
    return “Lighting should be turned off or at least reduced during unoccupied hours. However, some commissioning studies have found noticeable lighting energy use at night either because lighting schedules are improperly configured or occupants forget to turn off lights when vacating a building. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the lighting system (controller) during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on a physical model where certain parameter(s) is changed in EnergyPlus to mimic the faulted operation; thus simulates the effect of lighting setback being delayed until unoccupied hours by modifying the Schedule:Compact object in EnergyPlus assigned to lighting schedules. The fault intensity (F) is defined as the delay in the onset of overnight lighting setback (in hours).”
  end
  
## Modeler Description

  def modeler_description
    return “Five different user inputs are required; zone where the fault occurs, starting month of the faulted operation, ending month of the faulted operation, day of the week when the fault occurs, delayed time in hours. The measure detects the original (non-faulted) lighting schedule applied in EnergyPlus automatically, and adjusts the schedule based on user inputs.”

## Initial Condition

    runner.registerInitialCondition("Initial lighting profile in affected zones range from #{setpoint_values[:initial_ltg_min].min.round(1)} to #{setpoint_values[:initial_ltg_max].max.round(1)}")

## Final Condition

    runner.registerFinalCondition("Final lighting profile in affected zones range from #{setpoint_values[:final_ltg_min].min.round(1)} to #{setpoint_values[:final_ltg_max].max.round(1)}.")

## Not Applicable

runner.registerAsNotApplicable('Measure NoOvernightSetbackWeek not run')
runner.registerAsNotApplicable("No changes made, selected zones may not have had setpoint schedules, or they schedules may not have been ScheduleRulesets.")

## Tests

●	Test different sets of input arguments (starting/ending month, extended hours, day of week)
●	Test invalid user argument values to make sure measure fails gracefully.
