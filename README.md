# Overview of the Repository

Creating a comprehensive library of **OpenStudio fault models** and **automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) algorithms**

# Fault Model Library

### Features

- Physics-based fault impact simulation within the capability of EnergyPlus/OpenStudio

- Fault intensity implementation simulating how severe faults are (e.g., how much portion is fouled in the condenser heat exchanger) and estimating the impact of a fault in different fault intensities.

- Fault evolution implementation simulating evolving/increasing fault intensity (in linear scale) through certain period of time.

### Future goals

- what are common/typical faults in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.) ?

- how often (e.g., incidence and prevalence) faults occur in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.) ?
