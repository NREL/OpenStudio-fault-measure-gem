# Overview of the Openstudio Fault Models Gem

- Creating a comprehensive library of **OpenStudio fault models**
- Created/tested/validated with OpenStudio 2.8. Might not be compatible with later versions.

## Features

- Physics-based fault impact simulation within the capability of EnergyPlus/OpenStudio

- Fault intensity implementation simulating how severe faults are (e.g., how much portion is fouled in the condenser heat exchanger) and estimating the impact of a fault in different fault intensities.

- Fault evolution implementation simulating evolving/increasing fault intensity through certain period of time.

## Future goals

- what are common/typical faults in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.) ?

- how often (e.g., incidence and prevalence) faults occur in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.) ?

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'openstudio-fault-models'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install 'openstudio-fault-models'

# Usage

To be filled out later. 

## TODO

- [ ] Remove measures from OpenStudio-Measures to standardize on this location
- [ ] Update measures to code standards
- [ ] Review and fill out the gemspec file with author and gem description
